generally git commands are straightforward and convenient to use.
However, it requires deep understanding to make most of it.

Staging allows to grouping files as a unit and review them before committing

Branching adds high flexibility to take more bold steps which very appropriate
for experimental features.

Merging is great feature but requires requires deep understanding for the project
first before using it. However, I think to fully automated merging is to write
independent code where branch does not change to base code like adding a new feature
other than that manual merging is more appropriate.
